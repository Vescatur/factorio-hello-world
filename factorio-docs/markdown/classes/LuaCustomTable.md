# LuaCustomTable

_class_

Lazily evaluated table. For performance reasons, we sometimes return a custom table-like type instead of a native Lua table. This custom type lazily constructs the necessary Lua wrappers of the corresponding C++ objects, therefore preventing their unnecessary construction in some cases.

There are some notable consequences to the usage of a custom table type rather than the native Lua table type: Iterating a custom table is only possible using the `pairs` Lua function; `ipairs` won't work. Another key difference is that custom tables cannot be serialised into a game save file -- if saving the game would require serialisation of a custom table, an error will be displayed and the game will not be saved.

In previous versions of Factorio, this would create a [LuaPlayer](../classes/LuaPlayer.md) instance for every player in the game, even though only one such wrapper is needed. In the current version, accessing [game.players](../classes/LuaGameScript.md#players) by itself does not create any [LuaPlayer](../classes/LuaPlayer.md) instances; they are created lazily when accessed. Therefore, this example only constructs one [LuaPlayer](../classes/LuaPlayer.md) instance, no matter how many elements there are in `game.players`.

```
game.players["Oxyd"].character.die()
```

This statement will execute successfully and `storage.p` will be useable as one might expect. However, as soon as the user tries to save the game, a "LuaCustomTable cannot be serialized" error will be shown. The game will remain unsaveable so long as `storage.p` refers to an instance of a custom table.

```
storage.p = game.players  -- This has high potential to make the game unsaveable
```

The following will produce no output because `ipairs` is not supported with custom tables.

```
for _, p in ipairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end  -- incorrect; use pairs instead
```

**Example:**

```
-- Custom tables may be iterated using `pairs`.
for _, p in pairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end
```

## Attributes

| Name | Type | Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [object_name](#object-name) | [string](../concepts/string.md) |  |
| [valid](#valid) | [boolean](../concepts/boolean.md) |  |

### object_name

**Read:** [string](../concepts/string.md) · _read-only_

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

### valid

**Read:** [boolean](../concepts/boolean.md) · _read-only_

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.

## Operators

### index

`index()`

Access an element of this custom table.

### length

`length()`

Number of elements in this table.
