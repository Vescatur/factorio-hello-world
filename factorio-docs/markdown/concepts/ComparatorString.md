# ComparatorString

_concept_

A string that specifies how the inputs should be compared.

While the API accepts both versions for `"less/greater than or equal to"` and `"not equal"`, it'll always return `"≥"`, `"≤"` or `"≠"` respectively when reading them back.

**Definition:** `"="` ∣ `">"` ∣ `"<"` ∣ `"≥"` ∣ `">="` ∣ `"≤"` ∣ `"<="` ∣ `"≠"` ∣ `"!="`
