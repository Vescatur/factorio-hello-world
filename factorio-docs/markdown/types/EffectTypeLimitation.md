# EffectTypeLimitation

_type_

A list of [module](../prototypes/ModulePrototype.md) effects, or just a single effect. Modules with other effects cannot be used on the machine. This means that both effects from modules and from surrounding beacons are restricted to the listed effects. If `allowed_effects` is an empty array, the machine cannot be affected by modules or beacons.

**Examples:**

```
-- Allow all module types
allowed_effects = {"speed", "productivity", "consumption", "pollution", "quality"}
```

```
-- Allow only modules that affect speed
allowed_effects = "speed"
```

**Definition:** `"speed"` ∣ `"productivity"` ∣ `"consumption"` ∣ `"pollution"` ∣ `"quality"` ∣ array[`"speed"` ∣ `"productivity"` ∣ `"consumption"` ∣ `"pollution"` ∣ `"quality"`]
