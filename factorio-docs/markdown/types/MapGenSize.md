# MapGenSize

_type_

A floating point number specifying an amount.

For backwards compatibility, MapGenSizes can also be specified as a string, which will be converted to a number (when queried, a number will always be returned).

The map generation algorithm officially supports the range of values the in-game map generation screen shows (specifically `0` and values from `1/6` to `6`). Values outside this range are not guaranteed to work as expected.
