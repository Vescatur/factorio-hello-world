# BlendMode

_type_

Determines how sprites/animations should blend with the background. The possible values are listed below.

Note that in most of Factorio it is assumed colors are in alpha pre-multiplied format, see [FFF #172 - Blending and Rendering](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-172). Sprites get pre-multiplied when loaded, unless `premul_alpha` is set to `false` on the sprite/animation itself. Since generating mipmaps doesn't respect `premul_alpha`, lower mipmap levels will be in pre-multiplied format regardless.

**Definition:** `"normal"` ∣ `"additive"` ∣ `"additive-soft"` ∣ `"multiplicative"` ∣ `"multiplicative-with-alpha"` ∣ `"overwrite"`
